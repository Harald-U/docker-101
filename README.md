# Docker 101 

Dieser Workshop dient als Übung für meine Vorlesung "Verteilte Systeme" an der Dualen Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.

This workshop serves as an exercise for my lecture "Distributed Systems" at the Cooperative State University Baden-Wuerttemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.

This workshhop is based on the [Docker 101 Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/), created by Docker and others. I didn't want to put as much focus on "bind mounts" hence the fork.

This workshop is published on Github Pages [here](https://harald-u.github.io/docker-101).
